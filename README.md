<h2><i>Description </i></h2>
<p> This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

  <h2> Content </h2>

<p> The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
<br> <br> <br>
  
   <h2>Problem Statemtent </h2>

<p> By using these patient records, we will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not
<br> <br> <br>


  
<h2>Business objectives and constraints </h2>
<h3>1. The cost of a mis-classification can be high. </h3>
<h3>2. There is strict latency concerns. </h3>
 <h3>3. Because this project is from health domain, so we have to be very cautious about the results/outcomes. </h3>
